## @brief CMake build script for the uparser Fortran interface.
##
project (uparser_fortran Fortran)
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8)

## Build the uparser fortran static library.
file(GLOB F_SRCS "*.f90")
set(CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/modules")
add_library(uparser_fortran STATIC ${F_SRCS})
set_target_properties(uparser_fortran PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "uparser_fortran")
add_dependencies(uparser_fortran uparser)

##
## Workaround to install this target simultaneously with the main target.
## This is due to a cmake restriction: 
##  - Installing a target with the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property 
##    set to TRUE has undefined behavior. 
##  
## First: inform the build location of the target. 
get_target_property(UPARSER_FORTRAN_BUILD_LIB uparser_fortran LOCATION)

## Then : inform the location where the target is to be installed. 
set(UPARSER_FORTRAN_INSTALL_DIR ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

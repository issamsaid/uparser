# Guidelines for repository contributions
First of all thank you for taking the time or considering to contribute.
**uparser** is a dynamic project, therefor 
we are actively looking for volunteers to receive feedbacks and feature 
requests and more importantly to help us improve the library.
any help from the  scientific community is more than welcome.</br>
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **uparser**. These
are not strict rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes
in a pull request.

## How can I contribute
You are invited to fork the **develop**  branch into a **feature/feature_name** 
branch and put together your
modifications, suggestions and bug fixes into pull requests (requests to merge
your code from your own branch into the develop branch).
The unit tests of all your modifications should be also 
provided. Each of your pull requests should pass the build 
on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/issamsaid/uparser), before getting merged
into the **develop** branch. Once we believe that we reached a milestone a new
release will be merged on the **master** branch from the **develop** branch.
